# CWNet - AmigaDOS handler that allows uploading files to a TFTP server over a serial link (using SLIP)

Copyright (c) 2017, 2018, Constantin Wiemer

CWNet is an AmigaDOS handler that allows uploading files to a TFTP server over a serial link (using SLIP). I wrote it just for educational purposes and fun (and to finally complete a project which I had begun back in 1990...), so it has only basic functionality and will for sure contain bugs. If you are looking for a real networking solution for the Amiga that uses the serial interface, you should turn to Matt Dillon's [DNet](http://aminet.net/package/comm/net/dnet2.10.13.lha), which this project was inspired by.
